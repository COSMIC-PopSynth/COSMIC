# COSMIC
cosmic (Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code)

cosmic is a rapid binary population synthesis suite with a special purpose of generating realistic Milky Way compact binary populations. cosmic can also be used to evolve binaries with BSE in a python environment.

cosmic currently implements binary evolutionary processes using BSE (Hurley+2002). Several modifications have been applied to BSE to account for recent updates to binary evolution especially important to compact binary formation (e.g. metallicity-dependent stellar winds or black hole natal kick strengths). For a detailed discussion of these modifications, see Breivik+2018 in prep.
