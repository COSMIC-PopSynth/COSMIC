How to write a configuration file
=================================

The `cosmic-pop` command-line executable cannot run without a configuration file.
Each of the sections below lists inputs for COSMIC's modified version of BSE. Each input has a description of the allowed values and an example of what that section might look like in the INI format.

Here is a link to the most recent stable release version of the default
inifile for COSMIC: `Stable Version INIFILE <https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC/blob/master/examples/Params.ini>`_

Here is a link to the unstable development version of the default inifile for COSMIC: `Development Version INIFILE <https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC/blob/develop/examples/Params.ini>`_

``binary_state``         Each binary system will end its evolution in one of
                         three states

                            ``0`` : the system is still a binary at the end its 
                            evolution 

                            ``1`` : the system merged before the end of its 
                            evolution

                            ``2`` : the system was disrupted before the end of 
                            its evolution

``timestep_conditions``  timestep_conditions allow a user to pick specific time resolutions
                         to print at targeted stages of the binary evolution.
                         This is used in conjuction with the [bse] section value dtp to determine the
                         timestep resolution for printing to the bcm array.


                         As an example, if you only want to print to the bcm array with
                         1.0 Myr timesteps while a binary has not merged or been disrupted 
                         you would specify this as:

                            ``timestep_conditions =[['binstate==0', 'dtp=1.0']]``

                         Special examples include

                            ``timestep_conditions = 'dtp=None'`` : only the final time step is printed to the bcm array

                            ``timestep_conditions = 'dtp=1.0'`` : a single timestep applied to all evolutionary stages of the binary

    ; This is used in conjuction with the [bse] section value dtp to determine the resolution
    ; at which thing are printed into the so called bcm array
    ; For example, if you only want dtp set to a value while the system is
    ; intact i.e. has not merged or been disrupted you could do so with the following
    ; timestep_conditions =[['binstate==0', 'dtp=1.0']]
    ; Special examples include
    ; timestep_conditions = 'dtp=None', only the final time step is printed to the bcm array

                            independent parameter distributions for the primary
                            mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, separation, and

``SF_start``             Sets the time in the past when star formation initiates in Myr.

``metallicity``          Single value for the metallicity of the population
                         where solar metallicity is defined using *zsun* defined below

``convergence_limits``       Specifies limits for parameters included in the convergence
                             params list. If specified, the lower and upper limit must 
                             be specified:  

                                ``convergence_limits = {'mass_1' : [5, 10], 'sep' : [0, 10]}``

``convergence_filter``       Selects the stage of the evolution at which you would like
                             to check for convergence. This will filter for systems that
                             satisfy the final_kstar1 and final_kstar2 selections from

                                user-specified final kstars

``match``                    match provides the tolerance for the convergence calculation
                             and is calculated as match = Log\ :sub:`10` (1-convergence)

``bcm_bpp_initCond_filter``  The bcm_bpp_initCond_filter will filter the bcm, bpp, and initCond 
                             DataFrames to only contain the binaries that satisfy the constraints
                             from ``convergence_limits`` and/or ``convergence_filer`` 

                                ``True``: bcm, bpp, initCond will contain only the binaries which 
                                are in the conv DataFrame

                                ``False``: bcm, bpp, initCond will contain all systems which satisfy the

    COMMON ENVELOPE FLAGS

**Note:** there are cases where a common envelope is forced regardless of the 
critical mass ratio for unstable mass transfer. In the following cases, a 
common envelope occurs regardless of the choices below:

**contact** : the stellar radii go into contact (common for similar ZAMS systems)

**periapse contact** : the periapse distance is smaller than either of the stellar radii (common for highly eccentric systems)

**core Roche overflow** : either of the stellar radii overflow their component's Roche radius (in this case, mass transfer from the convective core is always dynamically unstable)

=======================  =====================================================
``alpha1``               Common-envelope efficiency parameter which scales the 
                         efficiency of transferring orbital energy to the 
                         envelope. See `Equation 71 in Hurley+2002 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2002MNRAS.329..897H&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST&high=#page=11>`_.
