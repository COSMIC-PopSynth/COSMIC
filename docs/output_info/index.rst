Evolutionary states of stars/binaries
-------------------------------------

Since COSMIC uses BSE as it's core binary evolution algorithm, the output of COSMIC follows most of the same conventions as BSE. The kstar values and evolution stages are nearly identical to their BSE counterparts.

The kstar value specifies the evolutionary state of the star:

kick_info
---------
kick_info is a (2,17) array that tracks information about supernova
kicks. This allows us to track the total change to the systemic
velocity and the total change in the orbital plane tilt after both
supernovae, as well as reproduce systems.
The first row contains information about the first supernova that
occurs, the second row the second supernova.
Note that some values the second row will take into account the
effect of the first SN (e.g., kick_info[2,10] is the total systemic
velocity after both supernovae).
