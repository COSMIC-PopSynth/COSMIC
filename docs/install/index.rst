Installation Notes/FAQ
----------------------

.. note::

    USING IPYTHON OR JUPYTER-NOTEBOOKS WITH COSMIC ENVIRONMENT

    Please note that using the global instance of the conda jupyter-notebook
    or ipython will most likely fail when trying to use COSMIC.
    PLEASE explicitly install both into the COSMIC environment with either

    ``conda install jupyter ipython``

    ``pip install jupyter ipython``

.. note::

    USING COMSIC WHEN BUILT FROM SOURCE

    If you want import the fortran wrapped library
    from the GITHUB folder itself, i.e.

    ``from cosmic import _evolvebin``

    then you must build the extension locally

    ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace``
